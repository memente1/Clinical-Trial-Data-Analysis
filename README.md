Hypertension significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a newly developed drug intended to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients.The primary aim is to determine the effectiveness and safety of the new antihypertensive drug through comprehensive analysis of clinical trial data. Data from a clinical trial involving 225 hypertensive patients were analyzed. The trial data included variables such as baseline blood pressure, post-treatment blood pressure, side effects, patient demographics, adherence levels, and follow-up durations. Statistical analyses, including paired t-tests, chi-square tests, regression modeling, and longitudinal analysis, were performed to evaluate the drug's efficacy, safety, and predictive factors for treatment response.
